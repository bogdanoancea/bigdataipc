\begin{abstract}
Internet has been widely recognized as a new data source that can be used to compile new statistics or the enhance the 
traditional ones in several fields of official statistics. Considering that online commerce has a growing share in the 
overall household’s consumption, price statistics is one of the areas of official statistics that can have important 
benefits from this new data source. There have been several projects developed by official statistics agencies to explore the potential 
of web-scrapping techniques to enhance the current statistical production, including the classical consumer price index (CPI). 
In this paper we describe the experience of NSI Romania regarding the collection of prices from Internet and 
using these data to compile an experimental CPI. The aim of our pilot project was to investigate whether 
the web-scrapping method of data collection for prices can be introduced in the production of official statistics in the near future 
and which are the methodological challenges that we have to deal with.  
We developed a chain of software tools that automates the whole process starting from the traditional methodology used 
for CPI and adding some new features such as a clustering technique and a 
distance-based method for matching similar products.

\section{Introduction}

Whether we use Internet for doing business, social networking, shopping or education, the quantity of data that 
we produce in our daily activities has recorded and exponential growth. Together with data produced by machines and sensors, these new and 
almost real-time large volumes of data that are generated today are commonly called Big Data. The first signs that Big Data sources 
can generate value and useful insights where given by private companies during the late 90s' but nowadays the European and national 
statistical systems has also witnessed major transformations because of the challenges raised by the big data sources. 

The incorporation of Big Data sources in the official statistical production does not aim to entirely replace the 
traditional methodologies but it is rather an iterative and incremental approach in which certain components of the traditional 
statistical production process are augmented by the Big Data sources inputs and the related processing algorithms 
\cite{grif2016_1}, \cite{grif2016_2}. Alternatively, big data sources can contribute to the reduction of the response burden 
or they can be used only to study some economic or social phenomena before designing a statistical survey which may be expensive. 

Speaking in other words, the incorporation of big data sources into the official statistics means maintaining a net competitive advantage and 
relevance of the official statistics products compared to those provided by a plethora of commercial players, with reference to 
large corporations that are active in the field of information technology \cite{eu2012}.

One of the main big data sources is the Web system that can be considered an immense reservoir of information and this source cannot be neglected
by official statistics institutes. In order to take advantage of the data publicly available on Web sites some automatic procedure for data collection 
should be designed first. These procedures are referred to under the term of web-scrapping.

Automatic data collection and its use to derive statistical indicators was pioneered by MIT \cite{MIT} where the prices collected 
from online shops were used to build a consumer price index for some South-American countries. Since this first experiment, several
statistical offices throughout the world started to collect data from online retailers and study how these data sets can be used
for consumer price index calculation. We can mention here Statistics Netherlands \cite{cbs}, ISTAT \cite{polidoro}  
or Destatis \cite{bruner} as some of the first statistical offices in Europe that experimented the web-scrapping technique for online prices, 
although they didn't follow the classical big data approach of MIT and only monitored some prices or tried to collect prices
only for the products included in the traditional collection method. The web-scrapping technique was used to collect data in other areas
of statistics too, for example to improve some statistical registers \cite{barcoli} or for job vacancies \cite{swier2}.
No matter how it was used, for bulk scrapping of all prices, or for only specific prices in certain areas \cite{cbs2} the web-scrapping technique 
proved to be a very useful method in the hand of statisticians.


Under these auspices, the overall objectives of our experimental project were to streamline the statistical production process by 
lowering the overall production costs, reduce the response burden and the dissemination term. Such projects, through the incorporation 
of modern computing technologies, could create the premises for developing a framework for testing and piloting new methodologies 
and technologies in a systematic and rigorous manner \cite{ons2017}. 


Our project experimented how web-scrapping collection method can be used to compute a new/experimental 
consumer price index (CPI) or to improve the classical CPI computation \cite{otawa2017}. We started our work by identifying and 
selecting online channels that have significant weights in the process of trading goods and services for household consumption. 
This is not an easy task given that there is no information on the volume of online transactions made by firms, 
issue found in other projects too \cite{willenborg2017}. The eloquent 
example is given by retailers in the hypermarket category, which although they have a physical trading correspondent with very high 
trading volumes, the volume of online transactions is unknown. The criteria used to select the online trading channels included in 
our study was to have a physical correspondent and record significant sales volumes at national level. Next, we proceeded with the 
task of identifying the appropriate means to implement the automated price collection process from e-commerce sites. The criteria 
used to identify the optimal solutions are expressed in terms of flexibility, ease of use, scalability and cost. An essential task 
to achieve this goal was to explore other approaches and test the existing solutions. 


Another objective of our project was to carry out the automatic price collection process over a relevant period: 6 months - 2 years. 
Achieving a maturity level specific to official price statistics that are currently published will require a much wider period of 
rigorous and systematic testing of the collection process and the results obtained. The resources available for running the data 
collection, technology and skills are critical and a continuity plan should be devised if some data sources become unavailable, 
legislative changes occur during this period, or the technology and skills are outdated by the evolution of the Web architecture. 


The next objective of our project was to compute an elementary price index at article/varietal and assortment level and compare 
it with those obtained using the traditional data collection method in order to emphasize the issues related to the difficulties 
of applying and/or adapting the traditional consumer price index (CPI) methodology \cite{cpi} to the new data sources.  A compromise to 
ensure a certain degree of comparability is the use of traditional CPI methodology \cite{cpi2}, \cite{cpi3} to estimate price indices, although 
traditional methodology may be incompatible from some points of view with the new data source. 


Last but not least, we intended to identify the legally sensitive aspects regarding the reconciliation between 
National Statistical Law, the European Statistics Code of Practice, other regulations on official statistics 
and legislation on access to online data \cite{swier}.

The paper is structured as follows. In section \ref{section2} we present details of the data collection process, 
in section \ref{methodology} we provide a description of the methodological approach, in section \ref{results} we present our first results and 
section \ref{conclusions} concludes our paper


\section{Data collection}\label{section2}

Some of the official statistics bureaus that have run similar projects have opted to outsource this component to companies specialized 
in collecting, processing and storing the data instead of acquiring the data directly. We explored several existing software solutions: 
Robot framework \cite{robot2018}, Scrapy \cite{scrapy1}, \cite{scrapy2} Apache Nutch \cite{nutch}, RSelenium \cite{rs1},
and \cite{rvest}. 
Based on an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of each solution we chose to work with the Robot framework. 


The observation unit was the web site of the retail companies. In this case, the assumption from which we started was 
that the companies cover the entire national territory through their site. Sites selection was based on establishing a 
sales-turnover relationship, sorting by decreasing order the sales figures reported by the firms that own the sites. 
At the present moment, there are certain barriers, for example the most important player in terms of turnover on the 
hypermarket segment in Romania, does not have a section dedicated to online transactions. We selected 4 sites for food, 
5 sites for clothing and 5 sites for footwear products. However, moves made at European level by firms that have physical 
stores on this segment suggest that market forces will require online migration of the most important players in the field.

The main variable collected from these sites was the price with VAT. The automatic collection method allows us to also 
record the prices for the goods and services affected by discounts, promotions, or other forms of attracting customers
through prices, so we can record the old price, and the discount shown as a percentage alongside with the displayed price. 
This facilitates, for example, the easy identification of seasonality factors that affect the price variation for
certain categories of goods and services. Prices are recorded in .csv files that contain the following variables: 
the article/varietal name (the name under which the article is marketed), current retail price, old price and/or 
retail discount if displayed, composition for clothes/footwear, a short description (manufacturer and technical 
specifications), the date collection and the website address. The selection of the products whose prices are kept
under observation is based on the CPI national standard classification. We collected about 50,000 to 70,000 records every month.


Data collection took place through the Robot Framework and RSelenium software solution. It is worth mentioning that Robot Framework is highly configurable through javascript procedures which can easily manipulate web content. This software solution proved to be a scalable web-scrapping tool that can fulfill the requirements of a 
large organization. The automatic collection of prices observed on the sites included in the sample was made during
the same period as for the traditional CPI survey. Due to the complexity of the data extracted through the 
web-scrapping process, i.e. of the semi-structured data gathered from the sites, the decomposition at the 
core components of the CPI classification is required first.


The structure of the data collected from the retailers’ sites for the food group of products contains the product 
name, the manufacturer, the quantity, certain technical-quality details, the price per unit or the price per piece, 
the article/varietal and assortment type, and the category according to the structure of the site. From the point of view 
of the classification of products in a given product category, these data may appear at a first glance 
as inputs for a manual or automatic classification procedure, but the very large number of products and the fact 
that the description is not standardized for all sites targeted by the collection process makes this stage to be considered as the most difficult one.

A trivial observation about the form of data is that they cannot be directly used in the process of classifying 
and estimating price indices. To address this issue, we have developed a series of R scripts that transform 
the data in a way that allows flexible handling. The CPI computation steps are sequentially deployed, the data 
input for each stage depending on the output of the previous stage, except for the first step whose input depends 
on the result of the automatic data collection.



In the following, the activities carried out at each stage will be detailed, noting that we attempted to keep the 
traditional CPI methodology as much as possible intact. A graphical representation of the data collection and processing is shown in \ref{fig:6}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=0.7\linewidth]{fig6.eps}
\caption{Data collection and processing session}
\label{fig:6}
\end{figure}


The first activity was the data cleaning. We started with 
the web scrapped files and performed some basic operations checking for missing data and other basic validation operations. 
In case there are missing items among the data sets, the web-scrapping process resumes, after checking the online accessibility 
of the site and the log files of the web-scrapping application. Some possible error sources could be: 
\begin{itemize}
\item sites were unavailable or have undergone changes;
\item the web-scrapping application encountered web content elements that cannot be directly processed;
\item web server identified the web-scrapping application as a malicious software and imposed an access restriction to the site at the IP address level.
\end{itemize}


Next, all the files obtained from the data collection process for a certain month are joined automatically. The resulting 
file is read by an R script and transformed into a data structure suitable for an automatic processing procedure. Some 
basic transformations are again performed using an automated R script before classifying and linking the products according 
to the CPI classification. We started with the manual product linking and classification according to the standard CPI 
classification which implies identifying the observations which contain a description similar to the one provided in the
classical CPI classification. This activity can generate errors whose propagation can significantly influence the quality 
of the results. The principle that we used in the absence of a previous experience in working with methodological aspects 
of selection of the articles was to assume that the consumer will choose a product or products substitutable to the one present 
in the standard classification within a reasonable price limit ($<= 150\%$ of the price of an article from the standard classification). 

Thus, we chose to select several articles for one assortment within the same observation point. To reinforce the strict tracking 
rule of the same articles found in the standard CPI methodology, we performed join operations between the data structures 
for all decades and observed months. The join operation between two or more tables was based on the "name" variable containing 
the product description by matching strings in a 1 to 1 ratio. After performing this activity, from an initial number 
of about 10,000 of articles, they were restricted to 545 articles, 216 assortments, and 52 expenditure groups, 
identified as constant during the 6 months of observation, assuming that the description given in the observations 
made for the variable "name" represents a guarantor for the invariance of the technical and qualitative characteristics 
of the articles. This technique was used to encode the entire sample.


Several attempts were made to develop an automatic encoding procedure with encouraging results. However, their use 
would involve deviations from the established methodological standard, manifested by the appearance and disappearance 
of the articles in the sample with a high frequency. We tried several machine learning and distance-based algorithms 
for this procedure and the results are presented in table 1. The best results, as it can be observed in \ref{table:1}, 
were obtained using the Levenshtein distance.

\section{Some methodological aspects}\label{methodology}

The scope of the project was to asses if online observed prices can be successfully used as a substitute data set for computing, either the traditional CPI or a similar experimental statistics, e.g. online observed CPI. Therefore, in order to retain, as much as possible, comparable results with the traditional CPI, the collection periods within a month, 
along with the goods and services included in the CPI national classification were preserved. Due to practical limitations regarding the allocated resources for this project, the data collection process was focused on food and beverages and items covering clothing and footwear categories, as these types of goods
hold the biggest share in household's consumption expenses, e.g. food accounts for nearly 40\% of total expenses\cite{hhs}. 

CPI is computed by weighted serial aggregation of elementary price indices at product/variety, assortment and group/category level, the entire process being a combination of traditional procedures\cite{cpi} and intermediate aggregations targeted at product survivability from one period to another. The process is being graphically described by \ref{fig:2}. After data pre-processing, i.e. testing if data is consistent with the computation requirements, removing duplicates, matching products across different periods, the first step requires prices aggregation into an arithmetic 
monthly average for each item, given that data was collected 3 times per month for food and beverages and once per month for clothes and shoes. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
\overline{p}_{v} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^n {p_{v_{j}}}}{n} ,
\end{equation} ,

\begin{center} 
	$\overline{p}_{v}$ = monthly price average for any given variety, \\
	$n$ = number of periods for which the price data was collected in a given month, \\
	$p_{v_{j}}$ = price of an item in $j^{th}$ period within a month
\end{center}

The average is used to compute elementary 
price indices at product/variety level, by dividing the current monthly average for an item to it's respective base period monthly average. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:2}
i_{p_{v}} = \frac{\overline{p}_{v_{current}}}{\overline{p}_{v_{base}}} ,
\end{equation}

\begin{center}	
	$i_{p_{v}}$ = elementary prices index for any given variety, \\
	$\overline{p}_{v_{current}}$ = current monthly price average, \\
	$\overline{p}_{v_{base}}$ = base monthly price average.
\end{center} 

To ensure that results are comparable at different periods and capture only pure price change, ideally would be to collect price data for the same products indefinitely\cite{cpi2}. In the real world, this is impractical due to different reasons. Therefore, price data collectors are equipped with a list of strict rules when products or services are no longer available and substitutes are needed. These rules may target product description(producer, weight, composition, etc.), store placement and local/national market share, or a combination of these is used to ensure that qualitative differences between products no longer available on the market and substitutes are minimal \cite{cpi}. According to different research studies on using Big Data to compile CPI conducted inside National Statistical Offices, item survivability in sample is the most common issue in preserving comparable results across longer periods\cite{ons2017, willenborg2017, tranzitivity, kints}. To address this issues an intermediate calculation step was necessary. Based on the optimal supervised classification score, price indices for similar items were clustered into a generic price index for the same statistical unit by using a geometric mean. For example, within the same statistical unit we collected at $t_{0}$ 3 products, according to the classification score, and at $t_{1}$ 2 products for the same assortment, to ensure the price change is kept within reasonable margins, we apply a geometric mean to cluster them into a generic product.   

\begin{equation}\label{eq:3}
i_{g} = \sqrt[n]{\prod_{j=1}^{n} i_{p_{v_{j}}}}
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
	$i_{g}$ = elementary price index for a generic product, \\
	$n$ = number of products within the same assortment based on the classification score, \\
	$i_{p_{v_{j}}}$ = the $j^{th}$ elementary price index within the same assortment
\end{center}

The subsequent calculations follow roughly the steps as in the Romanian National Institute of Statistics CPI methodology\cite{cpi}. taking into consideration that in order to obtain the price index at the expenditure category level, e.g. items containing white flour, we assigned to each category a weight equal to $\frac{1}{n}$,
where $n$ is the number of assortments identified as belonging to the same category. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:4}
i_{a} = \sqrt[n]{\prod_{j=1}^n i_{g_{j}}}
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
	$i_{a}$ = price index for an assortment, \\
	$n$ = number of statistical units per assortment, \\
	$i_{g_{j}}$ = elementary price index for a generic item in the $j^{th}$ statistical unit
\end{center}


\begin{equation}\label{eq:5}
i_{c} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^n i_{a_{j}}}{n}
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
	$i_{c}$ = price index for a category
	$n$ = number of assortments in the category, \\
	$i_{a_{j}}$ = the $j^{th}$ price index within an assortment
\end{center}

To obtain indices at group level, e.g. foods, in the last step, we used the weights from CPI methodology in order to aggregate category indices.  The following formula was used:


\begin{equation}\label{eq:6}
cr_{w_{g}} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{n_{c}}{w_{j_{c}}}}{\sum_{j=1}^{n_{b}}{w_{j_{b}}}}
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
	$cr_{w_{g}}$ = re-calibration coefficient for group weights, \\
	$n_{c}$ = current period number of categories belonging within a group, \\
	$n_{b}$ = base period number of categories belonging within a group, \\
	$w_{j_{c}}$ = the $j^{th}$ group weight for current period, \\
	$w_{j_{b}}$ = the $j^{th}$ group weight for base period
	
\end{center}

The re-calibration coefficient was applied to each weight from the classical CPI expenditure groups:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:7}
  w_{r} = w_{g} \times cr_{g}
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
	$w_{r}$ = re-calibrated weight, \\
	$w_{g}$ = initial weight, \\
	$cr_{g}$ = re-calibration coefficient
\end{center}

This intermediate stage is necessary due to potential absence of certain items from sample at any given moment in time, 
The final formula used was:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:8}
	i_{g} = \sum_{j=1}^{n} i_{c_{j}} \times w_{r_{j}}
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
	$i_{g}$ = price index at group level, \\
	$n$ = number of categories within a group, \\
	$i_{c_{j}}$ = price index of the $j^{th}$ category, \\
	$w_{r_{j}}$ = re-calibrated weight for the $j^{th}$ category
\end{center}

The process diagram is shown in \ref{fig:1} while in \ref{fig:2} we build a process diagram in terms of GSBPM\cite{gsbpm}. The GSPBM framework was used to attain a small, but highly modular production process. Secondly, the diagram was used a checks-and-balance

\section{Results and discussion } \label{results}

Using August 2017 as the basis for computation of the monthly price index, we obtained the aggregated indices at the 
groups of food, clothing and footwear presented in figures \ref{fig:3}, \ref{fig:4}, and \ref{fig:5}.


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{fig3.eps}

\end{figure}


\begin{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{fig5.eps}
\caption{The comparative evolution of the price indices for footwear}
\label{fig:5}
\end{figure}


From the evolution of the two price indices considered, it can be noticed that the online 
collection method implies a different trajectory due to the different samples used and the use 
of equal weights at assortment and expenditure group level. Another possible explanation can be found 
in the non-probabilistic sampling process through which online stores are selected ignoring the 
representativeness at national level due to the lack of specific information. Selected food, 
clothing and footwear stores can serve large cities and neighboring areas, having complex pricing 
policies which are different from small shops serving small city areas and rural communities.


\section{Conclusions and future developments}\label{conclusions}

This project was the first experiment that implemented a web-scrapping technique for data collection 
in our NSI. While we gained experience with the software tools involved in such a project we also 
identified some limitations for our specific study of online price collection which are briefly described below:
\begin{itemize}
\item Generalization hypothesis of online transactions. The number of households purchasing an 
online product is relatively small, and generally depends on several factors such as the geographical position, 
income level, education level, etc.
\item Not all businesses with a significant volume of transactions included in the list of observation 
units for traditional consumer price index has a website;
\item The IT technology can have a significant impact on price variation. An example of this may be the discrimination 
based on the geographic position of a user when displaying prices on a particular site;
\item The components of the classical consumer basket and the weights used at the level of the expenditure groups do not entirely reflect the consumption habits and the budget restrictions of the segment of the population addressed by the online stores.
\end{itemize}


Based on the results obtained and the potential of the web-scrapping collection method we intend to implement 
it to other official statistics areas and we will continue to develop a specific online price index [13], 
by extending the current collection procedures to the entire products and services nomenclature and by 
developing a new methodology based on online prices. Secondly, a separate product and service nomenclature may 
be developed specifically for online observations based on measurements such as the longevity of certain products 
and services in the online offer, and a series of metadata related to those products and services, for example, analysis of 
online interaction based on reviews of buyers with the respective brands and the online store.
